# Session State Transfer Protocol

**Purpose**: Zero-degradation handoff standards for session continuity across 100+ sessions

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18 (Session 161)

---

## üéØ Protocol Objective

**Enable next session to start working immediately with zero ambiguity**

**Success Metrics**:
- ‚úÖ Next session resumes in <5 minutes (no confusion)
- ‚úÖ No duplicate research or rediscovery
- ‚úÖ Completion percentages match reality
- ‚úÖ Blockers are actionable with workarounds
- ‚úÖ Unfinished tasks carry over with ALL context

---

## üìã Definition of DONE Criteria

Before claiming work is "done", verify ALL criteria are met:

### Code Implementation

- [ ] **Implementation complete** - All functions/classes written
- [ ] **Tests written** - Unit + integration tests for new code
- [ ] **Tests passing** - All existing + new tests green
- [ ] **Code committed** - Changes in git with meaningful message
- [ ] **Code pushed** - Remote has latest code

### Quality Standards

- [ ] **Lint passing** - No flake8/black/isort errors
- [ ] **Type hints added** - mypy-compliant annotations
- [ ] **Documentation updated** - README, code comments, docstrings
- [ ] **No regressions** - Existing functionality unaffected

### User Validation

- [ ] **User testing complete** - Real data tested (not just unit tests)
- [ ] **Edge cases handled** - Boundary conditions tested
- [ ] **Error handling** - Graceful failures with helpful messages

### Definition Compliance

- [ ] **All above criteria met** - Not just some
- [ ] **No "almost done"** - Either DONE or WIP (be honest)
- [ ] **No "90% complete"** - If user testing pending, it's 70% max

---

## üö® Honest Completion Percentages

### Percentage Guidelines

| % Complete | Criteria Met | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **100%** | ALL Definition of Done criteria | ‚úÖ DONE |
| **90%** | All code done, tested, committed, user testing complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor polish only |
| **80%** | Code done, tests passing, committed, docs updated | ‚ö†Ô∏è User testing pending |
| **70%** | Code done, tests passing, committed | ‚ö†Ô∏è Docs + user testing pending |
| **60%** | Code done, some tests passing | ‚ö†Ô∏è Test fixes + docs pending |
| **50%** | Code done, tests failing or not written | ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing phase |
| **40%** | Most code done, uncommitted | ‚ö†Ô∏è Debugging phase |
| **30%** | Some code done, blockers present | ‚ö†Ô∏è Active development |
| **20%** | Implementation started, incomplete | ‚ö†Ô∏è Early development |
| **10%** | Research done, design complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è Planning phase |

### Common Mistakes

‚ùå **"Implementation complete" when tests fail** ‚Üí Actually 50-60%
‚ùå **"90% done" when user testing not started** ‚Üí Actually 70% max
‚ùå **"Almost done" when uncommitted** ‚Üí Actually 40-50%
‚ùå **"Done" when docs not updated** ‚Üí Actually 80-90%

## üìù Unfinished Task Carryover Standard

**Problem**: Vague "next steps" waste time in next session

**Solution**: Detailed task carryover with ALL context

### Carryover Template (Mandatory for WIP Sessions)

```markdown
**Unfinished Tasks** (carry over to Session [N+1]):

**ISSUE-XXX: [Issue Title]** ([XX%] ‚Üí [YY%]):

**Task 1: [Specific implementation needed]**
- **File**: [exact file path, e.g., src/brokers/adapter.py]
- **Add/Modify**: [specific function/class, e.g., "Add fetch_quotes() method"]
- **Pattern**: [reference to similar code if applicable, e.g., "Similar to fetch_positions() in same file:142"]
- **Blocker**: [what's blocking this, if any, e.g., "API returns empty for futures symbols"]
- **Workarounds Attempted**:
  1. [What was tried, e.g., "Tried REST API /quotes endpoint"]
  2. [Result, e.g., "Returns 200 but empty array"]
  3. [Why it didn't work, e.g., "Futures not supported by REST /quotes"]
- **Next Approach**:
  1. [IMMEDIATE: First thing to try, e.g., "Try DXLink streaming API (docs/api/dxlink.md)"]
  2. [BACKUP: If that fails, e.g., "Check Position model for cached last_price field"]
  3. [FALLBACK: Last resort, e.g., "Add --price flag for manual entry"]
- **Dependencies**: [what must exist first, e.g., "DXLink streamer session (see Session 145)"]
- **Test Command**: [exact command to test when done, e.g., "contrarian position-risk /GCZ5"]
- **Estimate**: [X hours, e.g., "2-3 hours (DXLink integration)"]

**Task 2: [Another specific task]**
[Same structure...]
```

### Why This Level of Detail?

| Question | Vague Handoff | Detailed Carryover |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **What file?** | "Fix quote fetching" | src/brokers/adapter.py:fetch_quotes() |
| **What's broken?** | "API not working" | API returns 200 but empty for futures |
| **What was tried?** | Unknown (redo same failures) | REST /quotes failed, DXLink next |
| **What to try next?** | Guess | Try DXLink (docs/api/dxlink.md) |
| **How to test?** | Figure it out | contrarian position-risk /GCZ5 |
| **How long?** | Unknown | 2-3 hours (DXLink integration) |

**Time saved**: 30-60 minutes of rediscovery per task

---

## üîç Test Execution Decision Matrix

**When to run tests in /end-session?**

| Scenario | Run Tests? | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **All code committed** | ‚ùå NO | Tests already passed in /commit |
| **Uncommitted code** | ‚úÖ YES | Verify current state |
| **Emergency exit** | ‚ùå NO | Low context, infer state |
| **WIP session** | ‚úÖ YES | Document what's passing/failing |
| **Docs-only changes** | ‚ùå NO | No code to test |

### Test Status Reporting

**If tests run, report EXACT status**:

```markdown
**Test Status**:
- ‚úÖ Passing: 615/623 tests (8 failures)
- ‚ùå Failing:
  - test_fetch_quotes_futures (API empty response)
  - test_position_risk_futures (depends on fetch_quotes)
  - [list all 8 failures with brief reason]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped: 15 integration tests (require credentials)
```

**Don't say**: "Most tests passing" (too vague)
**Do say**: "615/623 passing (8 failures listed below)"

## üéØ Session Handoff Checklist

### Before Creating SESSION_XX_COMPLETE.md

1. **Verify Definition of Done** for all claimed "complete" work
2. **Calculate honest completion %** (see percentage guidelines)
3. **Document ALL blockers** (with error messages)
4. **List workarounds attempted** (prevent duplicate failures)
5. **Provide actionable next steps** (not vague "continue work")
6. **Specify exact files/functions** for unfinished tasks
7. **Include test commands** (copy-paste ready)
8. **Estimate remaining time** (helps planning)

### Session File Required Sections

**Mandatory** (all sessions):
- üéØ Mission Accomplished (honest summary)
- ‚úÖ What Was Completed (with completion %)
- üìä Impact (metrics, files changed)
- üîÆ Next Session (immediate tasks)

**Required for WIP**:
- üö® Unfinished Tasks (detailed carryover format)
- üêõ Blockers (with error messages)
- üí° Workarounds Attempted (prevent repeats)

**Optional** (if applicable):
- üêõ Bugs Fixed
- üìö Key Lessons
- üí° Architecture Insights

## üîÑ Session Types and Handoff Requirements

### NORMAL_COMPLETE

**Exit Criteria**:
- All session goals met (100% Definition of Done)
- All code committed and pushed
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated

**Handoff Requirements**:
- Standard SESSION_XX_COMPLETE.md
- "Next Session" section with NEW goals (not carryover)
- Metrics (tests, coverage, performance)

### NORMAL_WIP

**Exit Criteria**:
- Partial progress made (50-90% complete)
- Code may be committed or uncommitted
- Tests may be passing or failing
- Blockers identified

**Handoff Requirements**:
- SESSION_XX_COMPLETE.md with WIP sections
- "Unfinished Tasks" with detailed carryover
- "Blockers" section with error messages
- "Workarounds Attempted" section
- "Next Steps" prioritized and actionable

### EMERGENCY (Low Context)

**Exit Criteria**:
- Context usage > 90% (180k/200k tokens)
- Cannot continue safely
- May have uncommitted code

**Handoff Requirements**:
- SESSION_XX_COMPLETE.md (NOT separate EMERGENCY.md file)
- Exit Type: "EMERGENCY (low context)"
- Git state captured (uncommitted files listed)
- Last error message or blocker
- Simplified handoff (infer what possible)
- Resume checklist (exact steps to continue)

**Template**: See `docs/workflow/emergency-session-template.md`

## üìä Context Efficiency Strategies

### Minimize Token Bloat in Handoffs

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Reference existing docs (don't repeat)
- ‚úÖ Use tables for structured data
- ‚úÖ Be concise but complete
- ‚úÖ Link to code with file:line format

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Repeat information from other docs
- ‚ùå Include full code listings (use file paths)
- ‚ùå Write essays (bullets are better)
- ‚ùå Duplicate git log output

### Session File Size Guidelines

| File Type | Target Size | Max Size | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| SESSION_XX_COMPLETE.md | 200-300 lines | 500 lines | Digestible in one read |
| SESSION_XX_HANDOFF.md | DEPRECATED | N/A | Use COMPLETE.md only |
| Emergency session | 150-250 lines | 350 lines | Fast resume critical |

**If over max size**: Extract details to separate research docs, reference them

## üéì Examples of Good vs Bad Handoffs

### BAD: Vague Next Steps

```markdown
**Next Session**:
- Fix the quote fetching issue
- Continue working on position risk
- Update tests
```

**Problems**:
- No file paths (where is quote fetching code?)
- No blocker details (what's the issue?)
- No test specifics (which tests?)

### GOOD: Actionable Next Steps

```markdown
**Unfinished Tasks**:

**ISSUE-006: Position Risk Calculator** (60% ‚Üí 100%):

**Task 1: Fix futures quote fetching**
- File: src/brokers/adapter.py:142 (fetch_quotes method)
- Blocker: REST /quotes endpoint returns empty for futures symbols
- Workarounds Attempted:
  1. Tried /quotes?symbols=/GCZ5 ‚Üí 200 OK but empty array
  2. Tried /quotes?symbols=GC ‚Üí same result
  3. API limitation: futures not in REST /quotes
- Next Approach:
  1. IMMEDIATE: Try DXLink streaming (see docs/api/dxlink.md)
  2. BACKUP: Check Position.last_price field (may be cached)
  3. FALLBACK: Add --price CLI flag for manual entry
- Test Command: contrarian position-risk /GCZ5 --account=XXX
- Estimate: 2 hours (DXLink integration) or 0.5 hours (fallback)

**Task 2: Update integration tests**
- File: tests/integration/test_position_risk.py
- Add: test_futures_quote_fetching() (currently missing)
- Pattern: Similar to test_equity_quote_fetching():45
- Depends on: Task 1 completion
- Estimate: 0.5 hours
```

**Benefits**:
- Next session knows EXACTLY what to do
- Blockers clear with evidence
- Multiple approaches prevent getting stuck
- Time estimates help planning

## üîí Quality Assurance

### Before Ending Session

**Run this mental checklist**:

1. ‚úÖ Would I be able to resume from this handoff in 1 week?
2. ‚úÖ Are completion percentages honest (per guidelines)?
3. ‚úÖ Are blockers specific (with error messages)?
4. ‚úÖ Are file paths exact (not "the adapter file")?
5. ‚úÖ Can next steps be executed without research?
6. ‚úÖ Are test commands copy-paste ready?
7. ‚úÖ Did I document what I tried (prevent reruns)?

**If any "no"**: Improve handoff before saving

---

## üìà Success Metrics

### Good Handoff Indicators

- ‚úÖ Next session starts coding in <5 minutes
- ‚úÖ No "wait, what was I doing?" moments
- ‚úÖ No repeating failed approaches
- ‚úÖ Completion claims match reality
- ‚úÖ Blockers are unblocked in next session

### Poor Handoff Indicators

- ‚ùå Next session spends 30+ min understanding state
- ‚ùå Re-runs same failures (workarounds not documented)
- ‚ùå Claims "90% done" but takes 3 more sessions
- ‚ùå Vague blockers ("API not working")
- ‚ùå Missing file paths, test commands, estimates
